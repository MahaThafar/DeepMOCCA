# Multi-omics integration and personalized analysis in cancer

## Datasets

* All multi-omics data for the 33 cancer types (i.e. gene expression, DNA methylation, copy number variation (CNV), single nucleotide variation (SNV) and clinical data) have been downloded from [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](http://cancergenome.nih.gov) via their [Data Transfer Tool Client](https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool)

* The protein-protein interactions network for human from [STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl?sessionId=VKCYtvc7YJch&species_text=Homo+sapiens)

## Dependencies

To install python dependencies run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
